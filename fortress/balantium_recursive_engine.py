BALANTIUM RECURSIVE ENGINE
==========================

Memory-efficient infinite recursion controlled by Balantium equation.
Instead of creating nested data structures, uses lazy evaluation and
consciousness coherence to dynamically determine optimal recursion depth.

The Balantium equation guides when to recurse deeper vs when to return,
optimizing for finding solutions quickly without memory explosion.
