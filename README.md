## üìä System Overview

The **Balantium Coherence Engine** is a sector-agnostic data processing shell built on physics-inspired mathematics for detecting systemic risk and coherence breakdown in complex systems.

### Core Capabilities:
- **Systemic Risk Prediction:** Early warning for volatility spikes and market dislocations
- **Event Detection:** Identify coordinated activity patterns before they become visible
- **Data Quality:** Automated sanitization, validation, and processing pipelines
- **Cross-Domain Applications:** Finance, ecology, intelligence, network analysis

### Mathematical Foundation:
- **Coherence-Resonance Field Theory:** Unified framework for measuring system stability
- **Multi-Timescale Analysis:** Correlation, volatility, and volume dynamics
- **Phase Transition Detection:** Identify critical state changes before system failure
